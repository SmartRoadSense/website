The brand new **version&nbsp;4.0** of the *SmartRoadSense* mobile app is now available:
it introduces an entirely new mode that allow users to play with the data they just collected.
Players will have to transport frangible objects on a vehicle moving on uneven terrain, which is generated using precedently collected road quality data.

The game, developed in cooperation with the *Disruptive Media Learning Lab* at Coventry University, within the [CROWD4ROADS](http://www.c4rs.eu) project, aims at giving users insight into the data they collected and making them more aware of road maintenance issues.
