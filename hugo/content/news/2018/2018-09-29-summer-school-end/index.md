On the 25th September morning we kicked off the CROWD4ROADS “[Crowdsourcing for the Common Good](http://www.c4rs.eu/summer-school/)” Summer School, hosted by the University of Urbino at Collegio Raffaello in Urbino.
24&nbsp;people registered to the school for two days of sessions about collective intelligence, crowdsensing, data privacy, and gamification and the final “Data Jam” event.

Sessions included talks by Dragos Sebastian Cristea (University “Dunărea de Jos” of Galați) about Machine Learning, Marco Ciurcina from project [DECODE](https://www.decodeproject.eu), prof.&nbsp;Fabio Giglietto (for project [MINE2018](http://elezioni2018.news/)) Richard Tomlins (Coventry University), prof.&nbsp;Sylvester Arnab, and Mark Lewis.
Participants of the concluding hackaton event had the opportunity of working on real datasets provided by *SmartRoadSense*, [HackAIR](http://hackair.eu), [SmartCitizen](https://smartcitizen.me/) (DECODE), and [MINE2018](http://elezioni2018.news/).

We would also like to thank the participants of the two teams that presented their projects at the end of the “Data Jam”, after working hard until late the night before: Francesca&nbsp;Buso, Paolo&nbsp;Cappellacci, Gian&nbsp;Marco Di&nbsp;Francesco, Antonella&nbsp;Milanini, Erica&nbsp;Scatizza, Nicolò&nbsp;Tambone.
