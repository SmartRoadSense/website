This morning we were at the [convention center "La Nuvola"](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_Convention_Center) in Rome, to attend the [PA&nbsp;Forum](http://www.forumpa.it/) event on sustainable innovation for the Italian public administration as members of the [CROWD4ROADS](http://www.c4rs.eu)&nbsp;project.

Among a total of 258 projects, **CROWD4ROADS was selected** as one of the **noteworthy initiatives** for public administrations to meet the **innovation and sustainbility goals** established by the [UN&nbsp;2030&nbsp;Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).
