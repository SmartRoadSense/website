Our [CROWD4ROADS](http://www.c4rs.eu) team is back from Web&nbsp;Summit&nbsp;2018, the largest tech conference in Europe.
There they joined [other CAPS projects](https://capssi.eu/web-summit-was-a-blast/) at the **“Social Innovation Village”**, hosted by the [Social Good Accelerator](https://socialgoodaccelerator.eu/social-innovation-village/), and endured four intense days attending our booth, listening to talks, and walking around the huge area (mostly with a blank expression on their faces).

Founder of the Web [Tim&nbsp;Berners-Lee captivated the audience at the opening ceremony](https://twitter.com/crowd4roads/status/1059517081752887296?s=20) and stressed the obligations of the community to close the digital divide and fix the Web for everybody.
On day&nbsp;2, Microsoft vice-president Brad&nbsp;Smith and Tony&nbsp;Blair also underlined the disruptive capacity of the tech industry and [the need for political discourse to catch up](https://twitter.com/crowd4roads/status/1060188341713420289?s=20) with these changes.

Jeanne&nbsp;Bretécher for Génération&nbsp;2 led the “More Social Good in Tech, more Tech in Social Good” discussion, [focusing on changes to institutions](https://twitter.com/crowd4roads/status/1059808948197429248) that were not designed for the world we currently live in.
Talks continued during the “European Night” side-event at *Casa do Impacto*, with over 60&nbsp;participants.
