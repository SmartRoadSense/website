From the **6th to the 7th of June**, we will be at the [Digital Social Innovation Fair&nbsp;2018](https://dsifair.eu).
The event will be held at the **Campidoglio in Rome** and it will be a stimulating meeting point for several European [CAPSSI projects](https://capssi.eu/), with interesting talks, round-tables, and panels about digital innovation, digital platforms, crowdsourcing, open&nbsp;data, and much more&hellip;

We, together with our [CROWD4ROADS](http://www.c4rs.eu) partners, will be chairing the "[Collective intelligence and crowdsourcing for social good](https://dsifair.eu/collective-intelligence-and-crowdsourcing-for-social-good/)" workshop, 14:30--16:00 on Thursday 7th&nbsp;June.
