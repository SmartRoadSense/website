You may have already noticed butâ€¦ we have big plans for our project!

At the moment, only drivers on the Italian road network are able to use SmartRoadSense.
The idea of opening up the service for more drivers was always in the back of our heads.
However, only a few weeks ago, we started thinking seriously about how to make our platform available from other countries as well.

Days ago we took the first bold step: we moved our entire computing platform to **Marche Cloud**, the cloud service by Regione Marche (they are one of our partners in the [CROWD4ROADS](http://www.c4rs.eu) European project).

What does that mean?
It means that we now have all the computing power that we need to receive and process data from other countries!
More news coming soon.
