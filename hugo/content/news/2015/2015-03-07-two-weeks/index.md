Only two weeks have passed since the launch of *SmartRoadSense* in Italy.

Thanks to our first **150&nbsp;users**, *SmartRoadSense* has covered **more than 3,000&nbsp;kms of road**, it has processed more than **200&nbsp;millions** of acceleration readings, it has computed more than **700,000&nbsp;roughness estimates**, contributing to the [online interactive map]({{< langRef "data/map" >}}), and it has made available more than **14&nbsp;MBs** of open data online.

The results achieved are more than encouraging and describe the full potential of this tool and the strength of the **active participations by citizens** in monitoring public assets, such as road infrastructure.

Help us, it’s easy: just [download the Android app]({{< langRef "apps" >}}), install it, attach your smartphone to the car’s dashboard, and start recording every time you drive your car.

Apps for iOS and Windows Phone are under development.
