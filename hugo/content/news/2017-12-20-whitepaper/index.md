Thanks to the participation of Coventry University in the [CROWD4ROADS project](http://www.c4rs.eu) and the [Disruptive Media Learning Lab](https://dmll.org.uk/)â€™s&nbsp;(DMLL) expertise in adaptive learning techniques with an emphasis on *gamification* and learning through play, we are working to **introduce new game elements within the SmartRoadSense app**.

Read all about the this initiative, its objectives, the proposed design, and the gameplay of the upcoming "Balance Trucks" game in the [Whitepaper](http://www.c4rs.eu/news/whitepaper-lewis-crowd-sensing-and-gamification/) by Mark Lewis.
