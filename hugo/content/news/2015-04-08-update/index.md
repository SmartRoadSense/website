*SmartRoadSense* was [launched on 21 February]({{< langRef "news/2015-02-21-kick-off/index.md" >}}).
Since then, thanks to its early adopters, *SmartRoadSense* has monitored and mapped more than **1%** of Italian roads.

The net of coloured roads is growing fast, especially in the north of the peninsula.
Join the *SmartRoadSense* community and monitor the quality of the roads you travel every day!
