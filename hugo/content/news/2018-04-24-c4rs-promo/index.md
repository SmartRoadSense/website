We recently [posted a new promo video of the CROWD4ROADS project](https://www.facebook.com/crowd4roads/videos/1783663314987842/), by Prof. Alessandro Bogliolo: the project aims at involving drivers and citizens in road transport sustainability, through the rationalization of vehicle utilization, thanks to carpooling, and the adoption of easy-to-use instruments for the continuous monitoring of road quality, such as SmartRoadSense.

Check out the video on Youtube below.
