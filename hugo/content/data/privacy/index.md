<p class="lead">The <i>SmartRoadSense</i> mobile applications and its online services are designed to be fully anonymous and will never collect personal information from its users.</p>

*SmartRoadSense* mobile applications will access the following data:

* The user’s geographical location&nbsp;(GPS);
* Movement and accelerations on the user’s device&nbsp;(accelerometers);
* Absolute timestamps of the recorded data;
* The model name, manufacturer name, and other general technical metadata provided by the device;
* Any other personal data that will be provided explicitly by the user him/herself.

Communication protocols with the *SmartRoadSense* online service have been developed in order to be privacy-preserving by design:

* Data provided above is processed *on device* before transmission, producing coarse data with lower resolution than the source sensor data;
* Unique identifiers of recording sessions and other sensitive data are **never** transmitted to the online service and are kept on the device;
* No personal information is ever stored on our servers.

Data released by *SmartRoadSense*, either as publicly accessible Open Data or through developer APIs, are aggregated and devoid from any original data from single individuals.

The service is compliant with the [EU General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org) to be enforced on 25&nbsp;May&nbsp;2018.
