Over the course of the last 3&nbsp;years, *SmartRoadSense* has been part of the [CROWD4ROADS](http://c4rs.eu) project (or C4Rs, for short).
C4Rs combines 7&nbsp;partners across Europe under the “CAPSSI” umbrella (i.e., *Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innovation*), which aims at exploring the opportunities and potential for **Digital Social Innovation**&nbsp;(DSI) based on bottom-up solutions, citizen participation, openness, and decentralization, to tackle important issues that affect society.

The **Digital Social Innovation Manifesto**, drafted by a team of innovators, provides an insight into these concepts and how they can be applied to provide more powerful civic participation within democratic and social processes.
*SmartRoadSense* fully embraces many of the keypoints in the manifesto, including *openness* (open source software and open data), *decentralized* data collection to promote citizen awareness, *digital tool integration*, and *sustainability*.

Please, [take a look to the DSI&nbsp;Manifesto](https://www.dsimanifesto.eu/manifesto/) and take a minute to endorse it.&nbsp;✍
