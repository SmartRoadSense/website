After the heavy damage to road infrastructure caused by the recent heavy snowfall in Italy, the [University of Urbino](http://www.uniurb.it) has launched an appeal to car drivers and public transport operators to **join in the effort of road quality monitoring** by adopting SmartRoadSense.
Accurate and up to date information can help directing maintenance and reconstruction efforts, which ensure better driving comfort and safety while also lowering overall road transport expenditure.
