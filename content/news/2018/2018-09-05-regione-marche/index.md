This year, Regione&nbsp;Marche and the [CROWD4ROADS](http://www.c4rs.eu) project have [partnered in a long series of public events](http://www.regione.marche.it/News-ed-Eventi/Post/43630/OTTIMI-I-RISULTATI-DELLA-SINERGIA-TRA-IL-PROGETTO-EUROPEO-CROWD4ROADS-E-GLI-EVENTI-TURISTICI-REGIONALI) that were held during the summer months.
All events have been promoted by the region's administration and by local communities, promoting the adoption of *SmartRoadSense* and the use of trip sharing solutions such as BlaBlaCar.

The [Risorgi Marche festival](https://risorgimarche.it/) had a very large resonance among the local population and nearby regions, attracting more than 150.000&nbsp;people to attend live music shows organized in locations hit by the recent earthquake.
Similarly, the [PhotoWalk2018](https://www.destinazionemarche.it/photowalk-2018-nelle-marche-date-e-tappe/) has brought groups of participants to lesser known places in the Marches, to explore them, discover artistic, natural, or gastronomic highlights, while sharing the trip through social media.
Finally, the [Camper in viaggio](http://www.regione.marche.it/News-ed-Eventi/Post/45753/IL-CAMPER-IN-VIAGGIO-OPPORTUNITA-DAI-FONDI-UE-PER-LE-IMPRESE-E-LE-COMUNITA-COLPITE-DAL-SISMA) tour has been on the road since **21th September** and will reach the finishing line in the end of October, driving through several cities within Regione&nbsp;Marche while using *SmartRoadSense*.
