The project's website has just been updated: apart from the new coat of paint, the new website includes more [information about how the system works]({{< langRef "project/how" >}}), a revised [interactive map]({{< langRef "data/map" >}}), and a new [privacy policy]({{< langRef "data/privacy" >}}) that expands on how data from our contributors is anonymized.
