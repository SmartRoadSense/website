SmartRoadSense is proud to be an active part of the [Italian Open Government Week 2018](http://open.gov.it/saa2018/?lang=en)!
During this event, our project coordinator Prof.&nbsp;**Alessandro Bogliolo** is going to present the [new OpenData API]({{< langRef "data/developers" >}}) we released a few days ago.

This new SmartRoadSense feature will allow users to directly download sections of our continuously updated dataset in a simple way.
Developers will be able to simply specify the coordinates of the region they are interested in and download the requested data section encoded in JSON.

More details in the webinar by Prof. Alessandro Bogliolo (in Italian) embedded below.
